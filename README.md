# Web Guesser
__Created by: Garrett Smestad__
<br>
## Project Overview
Web Guesser is a small project to introduce Sinatra, HTML, and CSS.
<br>
The project runs a small web application using Sinatra. The web application generates a random number between 0 and 100, and requires the user to make a guess.
<br>
* __If the user guesses correctly__ - The background changes to green, and the message `"You got it right!"` is displayed.
<br><br>
* __If the user's guess is too high, but within 5__ - The background changes to red, and the message `"Too high!"` is displayed.
<br><br>
* __If the user's guess is too high, and more than 5 over__ - The background changes to dark red, and the message `"Way too high!"` is displayed.
<br><br>
* __If the user's guess is too low, but within 5__ - The background changes to red, and the message `"Too low!"` is displayed.
<br><br>
* __If the user's guess is too low, and more than 5 under__ - The background changes to dark red, and the message `"Way too low!"` is displayed.
